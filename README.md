# Recent Updates: Basic login page and page routes

Recently set up django. Use the backend folder if you are doing backend stuff. You will have to open both the frontend and backend folder at the same time on vscode. 
For the backend people PLEASE USE THIS BRANCH. The permit contact was not working correctly, but I fixed it to actually create a permit for specific users (edited some of the models.py stuff). There is also an api for the contact us which you can test out with your env files (or remove it temporarily if its bothering you), there is also the ability to grab the id. 

Try it out! Especially the contacts. It will work now, just without the API which we mainly need for the progress update with the webhooks? (and its part of the reqs) 

Call git checkout <branch> and git pull to get this branch's updated values. BUT, please go back to your own branch if you want to make changes. 

Tasks:
- Style the website + add department names/info
- Permit backend!
